  In the first two chapters, we introduced objects that have
  <em>Properties</em> and <em>Operations</em>. In addition to properties and
  operations, some objects have what are called <strong><em>Events</em></strong
  >. Events are like signals that are raised, for example, in response to user
  actions, like moving the mouse or clicking it. In some sense events are the
  opposite of operations. In the case of operation, you as a programmer call
  <p>
    it to make the computer do something; whereas in the case of events, the
    computer lets you know when something interesting has happened.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="How_are_events_useful"></a>How are events useful?</h3>
  <p>
    Events are central to introducing interactivity in a program. If you want to
    allow a user to interact with your program, events are what you’ll use. Say,
    you’re writing a Tic-Tac-Toe game. You’ll want to allow the user to choose
    his/her play, right? That’s where events come in - you receive user input
    from within your program using events. If this seems hard to grasp, don’t
    worry, we’ll take a look at a very simple example that will help you
    understand what events are and how they can be used.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Below is a very simple program that has just one statement and one
    subroutine. The subroutine uses the
    <em>ShowMessage</em> operation on the GraphicsWindow object to display a
    message box to the user.
  </p>

  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">GraphicsWindow.MouseDown = OnMouseDown

Sub OnMouseDown
GraphicsWindow.ShowMessage(&quot;You Clicked.&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;)
EndSub</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p class="BostonPostCard" style="margin-top: 10px;">
    The interesting part to note in the program above is the line where we
    assign the subroutine name to the
    <strong>MouseDown</strong> event of GraphicsWindow object. You’ll notice
    that MouseDown looks very much like a property – except that instead of
    assigning some value, we’re assigning the subroutine <em>OnMouseDown</em> to
    it. That’s what is special about events – when the event happens, the
    subroutine is called automatically. In this case, the subroutine
    <em>OnMouseDown</em> is called every time the user clicks using the mouse,
    on the GraphicsWindow. Go ahead, run the program and try it out. Anytime you
    click on the GraphicsWindow with your mouse, you’ll see a message box just
    like the one shown in the picture below.

    This kind of event handling is very powerful and allows for very creative
    and interesting programs. Programs written in this fashion are often called
    event-driven programs.
  </p>
  <p class="BostonPostCard" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    You can modify the <em>OnMouseDown</em> subroutine to do other things than
    popup a message box. For instance, like in the program below, you can draw
    big blue dots where the user clicks the mouse.
  </p>

  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">GraphicsWindow.BrushColor = &quot;Blue&quot;
GraphicsWindow.MouseDown = OnMouseDown

Sub OnMouseDown
x = GraphicsWindow.MouseX - 10
y = GraphicsWindow.MouseY - 10
GraphicsWindow.FillEllipse(x, y, 20, 20)
EndSub</code></pre>
  </div>

  </p>
  <p class="BostonPostCard">
    Notice that in the program above, we used <em>MouseX</em> and
    <em>MouseY</em> to get the mouse co-ordinates. We then use this to draw a
    circle using the mouse co-ordinates as the center of the circle.
  </p>

  <p class="BostonPostCard">
    There are really no limits to how many events you want to handle. You can
    even have one subroutine handle multiple events. However, you can handle an
    event only once. If you try to assign two subroutines to the same event, the
    second one wins.
  </p>
  <p class="BostonPostCard" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    To illustrate this, let’s take the previous example and add a subroutine
    that handles key presses. Also, let’s make this new subroutine change the
    color of the brush, so that when you click your mouse, you’ll get a
    different colored dot.
  </p>

  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">GraphicsWindow.BrushColor = &quot;Blue&quot;
GraphicsWindow.MouseDown = OnMouseDown
GraphicsWindow.KeyDown = OnKeyDown

Sub OnKeyDown
GraphicsWindow.BrushColor = GraphicsWindow.GetRandomColor()
EndSub

Sub OnMouseDown
x = GraphicsWindow.MouseX - 10
y = GraphicsWindow.MouseY - 10
GraphicsWindow.FillEllipse(x, y, 20, 20)
EndSub</code></pre>
  </div>

    If you ran this program and clicked on the window, you’ll get a blue dot.
    Now, if you press any key once and click again, you’ll get a different
    colored dot. What’s happening when you press a key is that the subroutine
    <em>OnKeyDown</em> gets executed which changes the brush color to a random
    color. After that when you click the mouse, a circle is drawn using the
    newly set color – giving the random color dots.
  </p>
  <h3 class="BostonPostCard"><a name="A_paint_program"></a>A paint program</h3>
  <p class="BostonPostCard" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Armed with events and subroutines, we can now write a program that lets
    users draw on the window. It’s surprisingly easy to write such a program,
    provided we break down the problem into smaller bits. As a first step, let’s
    write a program that will allow users to move the mouse anywhere on the
    graphics window, leaving a trail wherever they move the mouse.
  </p>

  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">GraphicsWindow.MouseMove = OnMouseMove

Sub OnMouseMove
x = GraphicsWindow.MouseX
y = GraphicsWindow.MouseY
GraphicsWindow.DrawLine(prevX, prevY, x, y)
prevX = x
prevY = y
EndSub</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p class="BostonPostCard" style="margin-top: 10px;">
    However, when you run this program, the first line always starts from the
    top left edge of the window (0, 0). We can fix this problem by handling the
    <em>MouseDown</em> event and capture the <em>prevX</em> and
    <em>prevY</em> values when that event comes.<em> </em>
  </p>
  <p class="BostonPostCard" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Also, we really only need the trail when the user has the mouse button down.
    Other times, we shouldn’t draw the line. In order to get this behavior,
    we’ll use the
    <em>IsLeftButtonDown</em> property on the <strong>Mouse</strong> object.
    This property tells whether the Left button is being held down or not. If
    this value is true, then we’ll draw the line, if not we’ll skip the line.
  </p>

  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">GraphicsWindow.MouseMove = OnMouseMove
GraphicsWindow.MouseDown = OnMouseDown

Sub OnMouseDown
prevX = GraphicsWindow.MouseX
prevY = GraphicsWindow.MouseY
EndSub

Sub OnMouseMove
x = GraphicsWindow.MouseX
y = GraphicsWindow.MouseY
If (Mouse.IsLeftButtonDown) Then
GraphicsWindow.DrawLine(prevX, prevY, x, y)
EndIf
prevX = x
prevY = y
EndSub</code></pre>
