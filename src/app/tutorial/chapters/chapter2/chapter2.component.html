  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    A program is a set of instructions for the computer. These instructions tell
    the computer precisely what to do, and the computer always follows these
    instructions. Just like people, computers can only follow instructions if
    specified in a language they can understand. These are called programming
    languages. There are very many languages that the computer can understand
    and <strong>Small Basic</strong> is one.

  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Imagine a conversation happening between you and your friend. You and your
    friends would use words, organized as sentences to convey information back
    and forth. Similarly, programming languages contain collections of words
    that can be organized into sentences that convey information to the
    computer. And programs are basically sets of sentences (sometimes just a few
    and sometimes many thousands) that together make sense to both the
    programmer and the computer alike.

  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    A typical Small Basic program consists of a bunch of statements. Every line
    of the program represents a statement and every statement is an instruction
    for the computer. When we ask the computer to execute a Small Basic program,
    it takes the program and reads the first statement. It understands what
    we’re trying to say and then executes our instruction͘ Once it’s done
    executing our first statement, it comes back to the program and reads and
    executes the second line. It continues to do so until it reaches the end of
    the program. That is when our program finishes.

  <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <a name="Back_to_Our_First_Program"></a>Back to Our First Program
  </h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Here is the first program we wrote:
  </p>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World")</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    This is a very simple program that consists of one statement. That statement
    tells the computer to write a line of text which is Hello World , into the
    Text Window. It literally translates in the computer’s mind to:
  </p>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">Write Hello World</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    You might have already noticed that the statement can in turn be split into
    smaller segments much like sentences can be split into words. In the first
    statement we have 3 distinct segments:
  </p>
  <ol type="a" style="font-weight: normal;">
    <li>TextWindow</li>
    <li>WriteLine</li>
    <li>“Hello World”</li>
  </ol>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    The dot, parentheses and the quotes are all punctuations that have to be
    placed at appropriate positions in the statement, for the computer to
    understand our intent.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    You might remember the black window that appeared when we ran our first
    program. That black window is called the TextWindow or sometimes referred to
    as the Console. That is where the result of this program goes. TextWindow,
    in our program, is called an object. There are a number of such objects
    available for us to use in our programs. We can perform several different
    operations on these objects. We’ve already used the WriteLine operation in
    our program. You might also have noticed that the WriteLine operation is
    followed by Hello World inside quotes. This text is passed as input to the
    WriteLine operation, which it then prints out to the user. This is called an
    input to the operation. Some operations take one or more inputs while others
    don’t take any͘.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Now that you have understood our first program, let’s go ahead and make it
      fancier by adding some colors.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">
      TextWindow.ForegroundColor = "Yellow"
      TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World")
    </code></pre>
  </div>

  <div>
    <div style="left:0px;top:0px">
      <img src="../../../../assets/tutorial/chapter2/1-adding-colors.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div class="cls_008">
      <span class="cls_008">Figure 5 - Adding Colors</span>
    </div>

    <div class="cls_007">
      <p>
        When you run the above program, you’ll notice that it prints out the
        same “Hello World” phrase inside TextWindow, but this time it prints it
        out in yellow instead of the gray that it did earlier.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="left:0px;top:0px">
      <img
        src="../../../../assets/tutorial/chapter2/2-hello-world-in-yellow.jpg"
      />
    </div>

    <div class="cls_008">
      <span class="cls_008">Figure 6 - Hello World in Yellow</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="cls_007">
    <span class="cls_007"
      >Notice the new statement we added to our original program. It uses a new
      word, </span
    ><span class="cls_010">ForegroundColor which we equated to a value of </span
    ><span class="cls_010">“Yellow.”</span><span class="cls_016"> </span
    ><span class="cls_007">This</span><span class="cls_016"> </span
    ><span class="cls_007">means we’ve </span
    ><span class="cls_010">assigned</span
    ><span class="cls_007"> “Yellow” to </span
    ><span class="cls_010"
      >ForegroundColor. Now, the difference between ForegroundColor and the
      operation WriteLine is that ForegroundColor did not take any inputs nor
      did it need any parenthesis. Instead it was followed by an </span
    ><span class="cls_010">equals to</span
    ><span class="cls_007">
      symbol and a word. We define ForegroundColor as a </span
    ><span class="cls_010">Property</span
    ><span class="cls_007">
      of TextWindow. Here is a list of values that are valid for the
      ForegroundColor property. Try replacing “Yellow” with one of these and see
      the results - don’t forget the quotes, they are required
      punctuations.</span
