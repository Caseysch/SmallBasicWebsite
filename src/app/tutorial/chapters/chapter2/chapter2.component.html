      <a name="understanding_our_first_program"></a>What really is a computer
      program?
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      A program is a set of instructions for the computer. These instructions
      tell the computer precisely what to do, and the computer always follows
      these instructions. Just like people, computers can only follow
      instructions if specified in a language they can understand. These are
      called programming languages. There are very many languages that the
      computer can understand and Small Basic is one.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Imagine a conversation happening between you and your friend. You and your
      friends would use words, organized as sentences to convey information back
      and forth. Similarly, programming languages contain collections of words
      that can be organized into sentences that convey information to the
      computer. And programs are basically sets of sentences (sometimes just a
      few and sometimes many thousands) that together make sense to both the
      programmer and the computer alike. There are many languages that the
      computer can understand. Java, C++, Python, VB, etc. are all powerful
      modern computer languages that are used to develop simple to complex
      software programs.

    <h3><a name="small_basic_programs"></a>Small Basic Programs</h3>
    <p>
      A typical Small Basic program consists of a bunch programs statements .
      Every line of the program represents a statement and every statement is an
      instruction for the computer. When we ask the computer to execute a Small
      Basic program, it takes the program and reads the first statement. It
      understands what we’re trying to say and then executes our instruction͘
      Once it’s done executing our first statement, it comes back to the program
      and reads and executes the second line. It continues to do so until it
      reaches the end of the program. That is when our program finishes.

    <h3><a name="our_first_program"></a>Back to Our First Program</h3>

  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World")</code></pre>
  </div>

    <p>
      This is a very simple program that consists of one statement That
      statement tells the computer to write a line of text which is Hello World,
      into the Text Window. It literally translates in the computer’s mind to:
      Write Hello World. You might have already noticed that the statement can
      in turn be split into smaller segments much like sentences can be split
      into words. In the first statement we have 3 distinct segments: a)
      TextWindow b) WriteLine c) “Hello World” The dot, parentheses and the
      quotes are all punctuations that have to be placed at appropriate
      positions in the statement, for the computer to understand our intent. You
      might remember the black window that appeared when we ran our first
      program. That black window is called the TextWindow or sometimes referred
      to as the Console. That is where the result of this program goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The TextWindowis called an object. There are a number of such objects
      available for us to use in our programs. We can perform several different
      operations on these objects. We’ve already used the WriteLine< operation
      in our program. You might also have noticed that the WriteLine operation
      is followed by Hello inside quotes. This text is passed as input
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctuations such as quotes, spaces and parenthesis are very important in
      a computer out to the user. This is called an input to the program. Based
      on their position and count, operation. Some operations take one or more
      they can change the meaning of what is being inputs while others don’t
      take any͘ expressed.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="our_second_program"></a>Our Second Program</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have understood our first program, let’s go ahead and make it
      fancier by adding some colors.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">
  TextWindow.ForegroundColor = "Yellow"
</code><code class="visual basic">
  TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World")
</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img
        title="Figure 2.2"
        alt="Figure 2.2"
        src="4eb7fd24-acbd-11e9-9d71-0cc47a792c0a_id_4eb7fd24-acbd-11e9-9d71-0cc47a792c0a_files/background08.jpg"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      When you run the above program, you’ll notice that it prints out the same
      “Hello World” phrase inside TextWindow, but this time it prints it out in
      yellow instead of the gray that it did earlier. Notice the new statement
      we added to our original program. It uses a new word, ForegroundColor
      which we equated to a value of “Yellow.” This means we’ve assigned
      “Yellow” to ForegroundColor. Now, the difference between ForegroundColor
      and the operation WriteLine is that ForegroundColor did not take any
      inputs nor did it need any parenthesis. Instead it was followed by an of
      TextWindow. Here is a list of values that are valid for the
      ForegroundColor property. Try replacing “Yellow” with one of these and see
      the results - don’t forget the quotes, they are required punctuations.
