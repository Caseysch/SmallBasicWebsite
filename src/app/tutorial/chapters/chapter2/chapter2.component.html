  <span class="cls_007"
    >A program is a set of instructions for the computer. These instructions
    tell the computer precisely what to do, and the computer always follows
    these instructions. Just like people, computers can only follow instructions
    if specified in a language they can understand. These are called programming
    languages. There are very many languages that the computer can understand
    and
  </span>
  <span class="cls_009">Small Basic</span>
  <span class="cls_007">
    is one. Imagine a conversation happening between you and your friend. You
    and your friends would use words,
  </span>
  <span class="cls_007"
    >organized as sentences to convey information back and forth. Similarly,
    programming languages contain</span

</div>

<div class="cls_007">
  <span class="cls_007"
    >collections of words that can be organized into sentences that convey
    information to the computer. And programs are basically sets of sentences
    (sometimes just a few and sometimes many thousands)</span

</div>
<div class="cls_007">
  <span class="cls_007">that together make sense to both the</span>

<div class="cls_012">
  <span class="cls_012">can understand. Java, C++, Python, VB, etc. are</span>

<div class="cls_006"><span class="cls_006">Small Basic Programs</span></div>
<div class="cls_012">
  <span class="cls_012">are used to develop simple to complex software</span>
</div>
<div class="cls_007">
  <span class="cls_007">A typical Small Basic program consists of a bunch</span>
</div>
<div class="cls_012"><span class="cls_012">programs.</span></div>

<div class="cls_007">
  <span class="cls_007">of </span><span class="cls_010">statements</span
  ><span class="cls_007"
    >. Every line of the program represents a statement and every statement is
    an instruction for the computer. When we ask the computer to execute a Small
    Basic program, it takes the program and reads the first statement. It
    understands what we’re trying to say and then executes our instruction͘ Once
    it’s done executing our first statement, it comes back to the program and
    reads and executes the second line. It continues to do so until it reaches
    the end of the program. That is when our program finishes.</span

    <span class="cls_006">Back to Our First Program</span>

  <div class="cls_007">
    <span class="cls_007">Here is the first program we wrote:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="cls_011">
    <span class="cls_011">TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World")</span>

<div class="cls_007">

    >This is a very simple program that consists of one </span
  ><span class="cls_010">statement</span
  ><span class="cls_007"
    >. That statement tells the computer to write a line of text which is </span
  ><span class="cls_009">Hello World</span
  ><span class="cls_007"
    >, into the Text Window. It literally translates in the computer’s mind to:
    Write</span
  ><span class="cls_011"> </span
  ><span class="cls_014"
    >Hello World You might have already noticed that the statement can in turn
    be split into smaller segments much like sentences can be split into words.
    In the first statement we have 3 distinct segments: a) TextWindow b)
    WriteLine c) “Hello World” The dot, parentheses and the quotes are all
    punctuations that have to be placed at appropriate positions in the
    statement, for the computer to understand our intent. You might remember the
    black window that appeared when we ran our first program. That black window
    is called the TextWindow or sometimes referred to as the Console. That is
    where the result of this program goes. </span
  ><span class="cls_009">TextWindow</span
  ><span class="cls_007">, in our program, is called an </span
  ><span class="cls_010">object</span
  ><span class="cls_007"

    programs. We can perform several different </span
  ><span class="cls_010">operations</span
  ><span class="cls_007"> on these objects. We’ve already used the</span
  ><span class="cls_010">WriteLine </span
  ><span class="cls_007"
    >operation in our program. You might also have noticed that the WriteLine
    operation is followed by </span
