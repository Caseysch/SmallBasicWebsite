    <p>
      In the 1970s, there was a very simple but powerful programming language,
      called Logo that was used by a few researchers. This was until someone
      added what is called “Turtle Graphics” to the language and made available
      a “Turtle” that was visible on the screen and responded to commands like
      <em>Move Forward, Turn Right, Turn Left,</em> etc. Using the Turtle,
      people were able to draw interesting shapes on the screen. This made the
      language immediately accessible and appealing to people of all ages, and
      was largely responsible for its wild popularity in the 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small Basic comes with a <strong>Turtle</strong> object with many commands
      that can be called from within Small Basic programs. In this chapter,
      we’ll use the Turtle to draw graphics on the screen.

    <h3><a name="The_Turtle"></a>The Turtle</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      To begin with, we need to make the Turtle visible on the screen. This can
      be achieved by a simple one line program.

      When you run this program you’ll notice a white window, just like the one
      we saw in the previous chapter, except this one has a Turtle in the
      center. It is this Turtle that is going to follow our instructions and
      draw whatever we ask it to.

    <h3><a name="Moving_and_Drawing"></a>Moving and Drawing</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
      One of the instructions that the Turtle understands is
      <strong>Move</strong>. This operation takes a number as input. This number
      tells the Turtle how far to move. Say, in the example below, we’ll ask the
      Turtle to move 100 pixels.
    </p>
    <div class="CodeHighlighter">
      <pre><code class="visual basic">Turtle.Move(100)</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      When you run this program, you can actually see the turtle move slowly a
      100 pixels upwards. As it moves, you’ll also notice it drawing a line
      behind it. When the Turtle has finished moving, the result will look
      something like the figure below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: When using operations on the Turtle, it is not
      necessary to call Show(). The Turtle will be automatically made visible
      whenever any Turtle operation is performed.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Drawing_a_Square"></a>Drawing a Square</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      A square has four sides, two vertical and two horizontal. In order to draw
      a square we need to be able to make the Turtle draw a line, turn right and
      draw another line and continue this until all four sides are finished. If
      we translated this to a program, here’s how it would look.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">

  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      When you run this program, you can see the Turtle drawing a square, one
      line at a time, and the result looks like the figure below.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">

      It will be interesting to note that we’re issuing the same two
      instructions over and over – four times precisely. And we’ve already
      learnt that such repetitive commands can be executed using loops. So, if
      we take the program above and modify it to use the
      <strong>For..EndFor</strong> loop, we’ll end up with a much simpler
      program.
    </p>

      The Turtle draws on the exact same GraphicsWindow that we saw in the
      previous chapter. This means that all the operations that we learned in
      the previous chapter are still valid here. For instance, the following
      program will draw the square with each side in a different color.
    </p>

  <div class="CodeHighlighter">

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      The Turtle, in addition to the <strong>TurnRight</strong> and
      <strong>TurnLeft</strong> operations, has a
      <strong>Turn</strong> operation. This operation takes one input which
      specifies the angle of rotation. Using this operation, it is possible to
      draw any sided polygon. The following program draws a hexagon (a six-sided
      polygon).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">For i = 1 To 6
Turtle.Move(100)
Turtle.Turn(60)
EndFor</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Try this program out to see if it really draws a hexagon. Observe that
      since the angle between the sides is 60 degrees, we use
      <strong>Turn(60)</strong>. For such a polygon, whose sides are all equal,
      the angle between the sides can be easily obtained by dividing 360 by the
      number of sides. Armed with this information and using variables, we can
      write a pretty generic program that can draw any sided polygon.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">sides = 12

length = 400 / sides
angle = 360 / sides

For i = 1 To sides
Turtle.Move(length)
Turtle.Turn(angle)
EndFor</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      Using this program, you can draw any polygon by just modifying the
      <strong>sides</strong> variable. Putting 4 here would give us the Square
      we started with. Putting a sufficiently large value, say 50 would make the
      result indistinguishable from a circle.

      <strong>Figure 8.4 - Drawing a 12 sided polygon</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Using the technique we just learned, we can make the Turtle draw multiple
      circles each time with a little shift resulting in an interesting output.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">sides = 50
length = 400 / sides
angle = 360 / sides

Turtle.Speed = 9

For j = 1 To 20
For i = 1 To sides
Turtle.Move(length)
Turtle.Turn(angle)
EndFor
Turtle.Turn(18)
EndFor</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      The program above has two <strong>For..EndFor</strong> loops, one within
      the other. The inner loop (<em>i = 1 to sides</em>) is similar to the
      polygon program and is responsible for drawing a circle. The outer loop
      (<em>j = 1 to 20</em>) is responsible for turning the Turtle by a small
      bit for every circle that is drawn. This tells the Turtle to draw 20
      circles. When put together, this program results in a very interesting
      pattern, like the one shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: In the program above, we have made the Turtle go
      faster by setting the Speed to 9. You can set this property to any value
      between 1 and 10 to make the Turtle go as fast as you want.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Moving_Around"></a>Moving Around</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      You can make the turtle not draw by calling the
      <strong>PenUp</strong> operation. This allows you to move the turtle to
      anywhere on the screen without drawing a line. Calling
      <strong>PenDown</strong> will make the turtle draw again. This can be used
      to get some interesting effects, like say, dotted lines. Here’s a program
      that uses this to draw a dotted line polygon.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">sides = 6

length = 400 / sides
angle = 360 / sides

For i = 1 To sides
For j = 1 To 6
Turtle.Move(length / 12)
Turtle.PenUp()
Turtle.Move(length / 12)
Turtle.PenDown()
EndFor
Turtle.Turn(angle)
EndFor</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      Again, this program has two loops. The inner loop draws a single dotted
      line, while the outer loop specifies how many lines to draw. In our
      example, we used 6 for the
      <strong>sides</strong> variable and hence we got a dotted line hexagon, as
      below.

    <p>You can use X and Y to position Turtle.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <strong>Note</strong>: if you set Turtle.X = 0 and Turtle.Y = 0, the
      location will be top left corner of the screen. You can always get
      Turtle's position by calling Turtle.X and Turtle.Y.
