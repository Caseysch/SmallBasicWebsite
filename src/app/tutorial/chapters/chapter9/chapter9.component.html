  <h3><a name="Subroutines"></a>Subroutines</h3>
  <p>
    Very often while writing programs we’ll run into cases where we’ll have to
    execute the same set of steps, over and over again. In those cases, it
    probably wouldn’t make sense to rewrite the same statements multiple times.
    That’s when
    <em>Subroutines</em> come in handy.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    A subroutine is a portion of code within a larger program that usually does
    something very specific, and that can be called from anywhere in the
    program. Subroutines are identified by a name that follows the
    <strong>Sub</strong> keyword and are terminated by the
    <strong>EndSub</strong> keyword. For example, the following snippet
    represents a subroutine whose name is <em>PrintTime</em>, and it does the
    job of printing the current time to the TextWindow.
  </p>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">Sub PrintTime
TextWindow.WriteLine(Clock.Time)
EndSub</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Below is a program that includes the subroutine and calls it from various
      places.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">PrintTime()
TextWindow.Write(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;)
name = TextWindow.Read()
TextWindow.Write(name &#43; &quot;, the time now is: &quot;)
PrintTime()

Sub PrintTime
TextWindow.WriteLine(Clock.Time)
EndSub</code></pre>
  </div>

      You execute a subroutine by calling <em>SubroutineName()</em>. As usual,
      the punctuators “()” are necessary to tell the computer that you want to
      execute a subroutine.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="Advantages_of_using_Subroutines"></a>Advantages of using
      Subroutines
    </h3>
    <p>
      As we just saw above, subroutines help reduce the amount of code you have
      to type in. Once you have the
      <em>PrintTime</em> subroutine written, you can call it from anywhere in
      your program and it’ll print the current time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: Remember, you can only call a SmallBasic subroutine
      from within the same program. You cannot call a subroutine from within
      another program.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, subroutines can help decompose complex problems into simpler
      pieces. Say you had a complex equation to solve, you can write several
      subroutines that solved smaller pieces of the complex equation. Then you
      can put the results together to get the solution to the original complex
      equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subroutines can also aid in improving the readability of a program. In
      other words, if you have well named subroutines for commonly run portions
      of your program, your program becomes easy to read and comprehend. This is
      very important if you want to understand someone else’s program or if you
      want your program to be understood by others. Sometimes, it is helpful
      even when you want to read your own program, say a week after you wrote
      it.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Using_variables"></a>Using variables</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      You can access and use any variable that you have in a program from within
      a subroutine. As an example, the following program accepts two numbers and
      prints out the larger of the two. Notice that the variable
      <em>max</em> is used both inside and outside of the subroutine.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">TextWindow.Write(&quot;Enter first number: &quot;)
num1 = TextWindow.ReadNumber()
TextWindow.Write(&quot;Enter second number: &quot;)
num2 = TextWindow.ReadNumber()

FindMax()
TextWindow.WriteLine(&quot;Maximum number is: &quot; &#43; max)

Sub FindMax
If (num1 &gt; num2) Then
max = num1
Else
max = num2
EndIf
EndSub</code></pre>

      Let’s look at another example that will illustrate the usage of
      Subroutines. This time we’ll use a graphics program that computes various
      points which it will store in variables
      <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. Then it calls a subroutine
      <strong>DrawCircleUsingCenter</strong> which is responsible for drawing a
      circle using <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> as the center

    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 0">
      <p>
        Here is the general format for how programs should be organized.
        Following this will make sure the programs work properly and are also
        easy to follow for someone looking at them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Variables go at the top of the program</li>
        <li>- Main program goes next</li>
        <li>- Subroutines should be at the bottom</li>

    <h3>
      <a name="Calling_Subroutines_inside_Loops"></a>Calling Subroutines inside
      Loops
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Sometimes subroutines get called from inside a loop, during which time
      they execute the same set of statements but with different values in one
      or more of the variables. For instance, say if you have a subroutine named
      <em>PrimeCheck</em> and this subroutine determines if a number is prime or
      not. You can write a program that lets the user to enter a value and you
      can then say if it is prime or not, using this subroutine. The program
      below illustrates that.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">TextWindow.Write(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;)
i = TextWindow.ReadNumber()
isPrime = &quot;True&quot;
PrimeCheck()
If (isPrime = &quot;True&quot;) Then
TextWindow.WriteLine(i &#43; &quot; is a prime number&quot;)
Else
TextWindow.WriteLine(i &#43; &quot; is not a prime number&quot;)
EndIf

Sub PrimeCheck
For j = 2 To Math.SquareRoot(i)
If (Math.Remainder(i, j) = 0) Then
isPrime = &quot;False&quot;
Goto EndLoop
EndIf
Endfor
EndLoop:
EndSub</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      The PrimeCheck subroutine takes the value of <em>i</em> and tries to
      divide it by smaller numbers. If a number divides <em>i</em> and leaves no
      remainder, then <em>i</em> is not a prime number. At that point the
      subroutine sets the value of <em>isPrime</em> to “False” and exits. If the
      number was indivisible by smaller numbers then the value of
      <em>isPrime</em> remains as “True.”
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img
        title="Figure 9.4 - Prime Check"
        alt="Figure 9.4 - Prime Check"
        src="../../../../assets/tutorial/chapter9/4-prime-check.jpg"
        width="491"

      /><br />
      <strong>Figure 9.4 - Prime Check</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Now that you have a subroutine that can do the Prime test for us, you
      might want to use this to list out all the prime numbers below, say, 100.
      It is really easy to modify the above program and make the call to
      <em>PrimeCheck</em> from inside a loop. This gives the subroutine a
      different value to compute each time the loop is run. Let’s see how this
      is done with the example below.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="CodeHighlighter">
    <pre><code class="visual basic">For i = 3 To 100
isPrime = &quot;True&quot;
PrimeCheck()
If (isPrime = &quot;True&quot;) Then
TextWindow.WriteLine(i)
EndIf
EndFor

Sub PrimeCheck
For j = 2 To Math.SquareRoot(i)
If (Math.Remainder(i, j) = 0) Then
isPrime = &quot;False&quot;
Goto EndLoop
EndIf
Endfor
EndLoop:
EndSub</code></pre>
  </div>
  <div class="BostonPostCard">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      In the program above, the value of <em>i</em> is updated every time the
      loop is run. Inside the loop, a call to the subroutine
      <em>PrimeCheck</em> is made. The subroutine <em>PrimeCheck</em> then takes
      the value of <em>i</em> and computes whether or not <em>i</em> is a prime
      number. This result is stored in the variable <em>isPrime</em> which is
      then accessed by the loop outside of the subroutine. The value of
      <em>i</em> is then printed if it turns out to be a prime number. And since
      the loop starts from 3 and goes up to 100, we get a list of all the prime
      numbers that are between 3 and 100. Below is the result of the program.
